# GLSL_SIDE
Simple IDE for GLSL (cross-platform written in JAVA), with autocompletion and dynamic compilation errors displayed on code.

Notes : 
- This is an alpha release, always keep a copy of your GLSL files, just in case.... ;)
- Do not hesitate to give me feedback.
- This is not yet tested on ATI cards, it's on my todo list
- The IDE is a bit oriented towards my custom 3D engine, which supports coding all shader stages in a single file: I have a precompiler that splits code. Do not be surprised you if the "#?" tags are not recognized by your official GLSL compilator :)
